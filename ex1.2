1.
example:using Google Map to find a path to drive to school.
function:finding "shortest" path from source to destination.

2.
insertion sort:8n²
merge sort:64nlgn
insertion better than merge:8n²<64nlgn
same as n<8lgn
n is between 32 and 64(acctually 43)
HINT:Don't forget n=1 !!!!
so n is in (2,43)

3.
100n²<2^n
n=15

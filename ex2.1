1.
show the process of insertion sorting A={31,41,59,26,41,58}
t=0   {31,41,59,26,41,58}(orginal, acctually the first element in the array)
t=1   {31,41,59,26,41,58}(the second element in the array)
t=2   {31,41,59,26,41,58}(the third)
t=3   {26,31,41,59,41,58}(the forth)
t=4   {26,31,41,41,59,58}(the fifth, only swap 59 and 41)
t=5   {26,31,41,41,58,59}(the sixth, swap 58 and 59)

2.
rewrite INSERTION-SORT to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing:
